## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Grid
- Flex
- BEM naming convention


### New Skills and Knowledge Gained from This Project

- auto-fit in CSS Grid:
I used auto-fit in grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...)) to make the grid adapt to the available space.
I learned that auto-fit automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the container width, and stretches the items to fill the row.
